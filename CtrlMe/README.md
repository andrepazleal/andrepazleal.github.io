Those are the final files of my term paper for college. Created an app using JS/CSS and published thru Phonegap to present an app that control the diet and nutrition of the user, giving the ability to add new meals according to the BMI of the user.
This was my first experience creating something for HTML5 before that only knew actionscript, it was an awesome experience and most of all lead to complete college.
